Code Connect is a tool for connecting your design system components in code with your design system in Figma. When using Code Connect, Figma's Dev Mode will display true-to-production code snippets from your design system instead of autogenerated code examples. In addition to connecting component definitions, Code Connect also supports mapping properties from code to Figma enabling dynamic and correct examples. This can be useful for when you have an existing design system and are looking to drive consistent and correct adoption of that design system across design and engineering.

Code Connect is easy to set up, easy to maintain, type-safe, and extensible. Out of the box Code Connect comes with support for React (and React Native), Storybook, HTML (e.g. Web Components, Angular and Vue), SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

Code Connect is available on Organization and Enterprise plans and requires a full Design or Dev Mode seat to use.

## CLI installation

To install Code Connect locally to a React project, you can follow the instructions in the [React README](docs/react.md#installation).

For other platforms, you first need to have Node.js v16 or newer installed on your computer. You can check if you already have Node.js installed and which version by running `node -v`. If you need to install Node.js, instructions for all platforms can be found [on the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can install Code Connect globally, so it can be run from anywhere on your machine, by running:

`npm install --global @figma/code-connect`

We hope to provide a way to install Code Connect without requiring Node.js soon.

## Setup

To learn how to implement Code Connect for your platform, please navigate to the platform-specific API usage and documentation.
